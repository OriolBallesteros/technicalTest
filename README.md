* Archicture: [Hexagonal Architecture](https://herbertograca.com/2017/11/16/explicit-architecture-01-ddd-hexagonal-onion-clean-cqrs-how-i-put-it-all-together/)

* Principles: 
  * [SOLID](https://www.baeldung.com/solid-principles)
  * [KISS](https://www.baeldung.com/java-clean-code)

* Using JUnit for testing due to simplicity reasons. In a real case scenario, following refactor might be changing it to [Groovy Spock](https://spockframework.org/) as an equally powerfull and simple testing framework.

* [Lombok's API](https://projectlombok.org/) usage was evaluated. While super-simple, yet powerful, and straightforward to use, for such a project it was considered unnecessary.
